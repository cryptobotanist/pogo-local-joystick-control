[[ jstest-gtk ]]
================

jstest-gtk is a simple joystick tester based on Gtk+. It provides you
with a list of attached joysticks, a way to display which buttons and
axis are pressed, a way to remap axis and buttons and a way to
calibrate your joystick.

You can find the latest version at:

 * http://github.com/Grumbel/jstest-gtk/tree/master

[[ Compiling ]]
===============

Make sure you have the following pieces of software installed (they
are part of most distributions):

 * scons
 * sigc++
 * gtkmm

You can compile it by typing:

 $ scons


[[ Usage ]]
===========

Once compiled you can start jstest-gtk with:

 $ ./jstest-gtk

or if you know the device you want to test with:

 $ ./jstest-gtk /dev/input/js0

The main window will provide you with a list of currently available
joysticks. When you double click a joystick it will display the Test
dialog, allowing you to test buttons and axes on the joystick.

The mapping dialog allows you to reorder the buttons and axis. This is
useful for example when a game expects the dpad to be on axis 0 and 1,
while in reality it is often on axis 4 and 5 on a dual-analogstick
gamepad.

The calibration dialog allows you to manipulate some low level details
on how the raw axis values are mapped to the joystick device. For
example you can inverse an axis, disable an axis or remove its
deadzone, to gain more fine control on small movements. This is
especially useful as the default calibration values for most joysticks
give it a far bigger deadzone then needed, thus reducing your ability
for fine movements.
